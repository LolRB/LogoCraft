# LogoCraft

## Overview

As a freelance web developer, I needed a straightforward solution for creating simple logos for my projects without the expense of hiring a graphic designer. This command-line tool enables users to design custom logos by specifying the text, text color, background shape, and background color. The end result is an SVG file ready to be integrated into your projects.

1. Start the application:

```bash
node index.js

2. Follow the prompts to customize your logo:

3. Once you've provided all the necessary information, the application will create an SVG file named logo.svg in the root directory.
